== Power consumption @ 3.3V
BLE: 16mA (typical on tx/rx)
PIC: 250mA max
TSOP38338: 3mA max
LED out:
Red LED power: 30mA (120mA peak)
Red LED power: 30mA (120mA peak)

Max total: 270mA


LED Resistors calculations
Green: (3.3 - 2.1)V = R * 0.02 mA -> R= 68 ohm
Red: (3.3 - 2.0)V = R * 0.02 mA -> R= 68 ohm
IRDA: (3.3 - 1.3)V = R * 0.100 mA -> R= 22 ohm
